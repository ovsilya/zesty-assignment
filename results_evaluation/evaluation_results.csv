Additionally, the difference between the Collision Rating Group of the Ducati Panigale V4 R (051) and the Honda Grom ABS (015) is 36, which exceeds 30 points.","Based on the information provided, here is the analysis for both parts of your question:

### Part 1: Comprehensive Coverage Rate Change Comparison

Yes, a resident living West of Nellis Boulevard in ZIP code 89110 faces a higher proposed percentage rate change for Comprehensive coverage compared to a resident living East of Nellis Boulevard.

**1. Territory Identification:**
*   **West of Nellis Boulevard (Territory 118):** The document `MCY Rate Filing Data Summary - SFFC.pdf` defines the area including ""The portion of ZIP Code 89110 west of Nellis Boulevard"" as part of Territory 118 (page 21).
*   **East of Nellis Boulevard (Territory 117):** The remainder of ZIP code 89110, which would be East of Nellis Boulevard, falls into Territory 117. This territory is described as the portions of ZIP codes 89030, 89110, and 89115 not included in Territory 118 (page 20, `MCY Rate Filing Data Summary - SFM.pdf`, table `(213128717-179157012)-MCY Rate Filing Data Summary - SFM_table_22`).

**2. Proposed Rate Changes:**

### Part 2: Motorcycle Collision Rating Group (GRG) Difference

Yes, the numeric difference between the Collision Rating Groups (GRG) of a 2023 Ducati Panigale V4 R and a 2023 Honda Grom ABS exceeds 30 points.

**1. GRG Values:**
While the question specifies 2023 models, the necessary values are located in the rate manual pages for 2024 models. The filing notes that it includes updates for both 2017-2023 and additional 2024 models.

*   **2023 Ducati Panigale V4 R:** The GRG is **51**.
    *   Source: `2024 CW Rate Manual Pages.pdf`, page 11, table `(213128625-179157161)-2024 CW Rate Manual Pages_table_10`
*   **2023 Honda Grom ABS:** The GRG is **15**.
    *   Source: `2024 CW Rate Manual Pages.pdf`, page 3, table `(213128625-179157161)-2024 CW Rate Manual Pages_table_2`

**2. Calculation:**
*   Difference = GRG of Ducati Panigale V4 R - GRG of Honda Grom ABS
*   Difference = 51 - 15 = **36**

The difference of 36 points is greater than 30.",hybrid,False,0.9,0.7777777777777778,,,,0.95,1.0,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,1.0,,,,,,
EF_3,"Using the Base Rate and the applicable Mandatory Hurricane Deductible Factor, calculate the unadjusted Hurricane premium for an HO3 policy with a $750,000 Coverage A limit located 3,000 feet from the coast in a Coastline Neighborhood.",$604,"To calculate the unadjusted Hurricane premium, we need to find the Hurricane Base Rate and the applicable Mandatory Hurricane Deductible Factor.

**1. Find the Hurricane Base Rate:**

*   According to the ""Base Rates"" table from the CT Homeowners MAPS Rate Pages, the Hurricane Base Rate is a fixed value.
*   In table `(215004905-180407973)-CT Homeowners MAPS Rate Pages Eff 8.18.25 v3_table_5` on page 4 of the ""CT Homeowners MAPS Rate Pages Eff 8.18.25 v3.pdf"", the value in the **Hurricane** column is **$293**.

**2. Determine the Applicable Hurricane Deductible Percentage:**

*   The policy is for a property located 3,000 feet from the coast.
*   According to the rules in ""CT MAPS Homeowner Rules Manual eff 08.18.25 v4.pdf"" on page 23, ""Properties located in the State designated “Coastline Neighborhoods” that are greater than > 2500 from the coast will receive a 2% deductible.""
*   Since 3,000 feet is greater than 2,500 feet, the applicable mandatory hurricane deductible is **2%**.

**3. Find the Mandatory Hurricane Deductible Factor:**

*   This factor is found in the ""Hurricane Deductible Factor"" table, which varies by Coverage A limit and the deductible percentage.
*   We will use table `(215004905-180407973)-CT Homeowners MAPS Rate Pages Eff 8.18.25 v3_table_119` on page 72 of the ""CT Homeowners MAPS Rate Pages Eff 8.18.25 v3.pdf"".
*   In this table, we look for the row corresponding to:
    *   **Policy Form:** HO3
    *   **Coverage A Limit:** $750,000
    *   **Applicable Hurricane Deductible:** 2%
*   The value in the **Hurricane** column for this row is **2.061**.

**4. Calculate the Unadjusted Hurricane Premium:**

*   **Formula:** Unadjusted Hurricane Premium = Hurricane Base Rate × Mandatory Hurricane Deductible Factor
*   **Calculation:** $293 × 2.061 = $603.873
*   **Rounding:** The final premium is rounded to the nearest dollar.

$603.873 rounds to **$604**.

**Final Answer:**

Based on the provided documents, the unadjusted Hurricane premium is calculated as follows:

*   **Hurricane Base Rate:** $293 (Source: CT Homeowners MAPS Rate Pages Eff 8.18.25 v3.pdf, page 4, table `(215004905-180407973)-CT Homeowners MAPS Rate Pages Eff 8.18.25 v3_table_5`)
*   **Mandatory Hurricane Deductible Factor:** 2.061 (Source: CT Homeowners MAPS Rate Pages Eff 8.18.25 v3.pdf, page 72, table `(215004905-180407973)-CT Homeowners MAPS Rate Pages Eff 8.18.25 v3_table_119`)
*   **Calculation:** $293 * 2.061 = $603.873

Rounding to the nearest dollar, the unadjusted Hurricane premium is **$604**.",hybrid,False,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,True,True,True,True,False,True
